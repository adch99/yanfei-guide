\[Write about Yanfei's role, how she plays, etc\]
## Pros
- Absurdly long range
\[TODO Add more pros\]
## Cons
- Low stamina due to constant Charge Attacks
\[TODO Add more cons\]

# Builds
Yanfei's role is a selfish main DPS. She will be on field most of the time, only swap to unleash the supports' skills and swap back.  
As with other Pyro DPS, there are generally two ways to build Yanfei based on the Elemental Reaction you want to use.
### Amp Yanfei
This build uses Vaporize or Melt to amplify Yanfei's damage. This means Yanfei will be the *trigger* for the reaction. Usually it'll be Vaporize, as Melt doesn't last long before Yanfei's Pyro application takes over. Due to some quirks in Yanfei's own kit, Amp Yanfei requires specific combo depending on your support. The combos will be discussed in detail further in this guide.

### Enabler Yanfei
This build uses Yanfei to apply Pyro *aura* and enable Elemental Reactions of your sub-DPS. Reverse Melt and Mono Pyro teams are in this category. Overload might be in this category as well if Yanfei is the aura, but that'll depend on your team.

# Talents


### Talent Priority
Normal Attack: Seal of Approval (AA) > Done Deal (Q) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Signed Edict (E)

Yanfei's kit is heavily focused on Charge Attack. Thus, it's natural to prioritise her Normal Attack talent first.  
Next, upgrade her Elemental Burst since it has increase Charge Attack DMG scaling on the Burst's Talent Level.  
The Elemental Skill doesn't help increasing the Charge Attack's damage at all, so you can safely leave it at level 6.

# Constellations
### C1
Best constellation. This constellation helps alleviate stamina issues and makes Yanfei able to spam more Charge Attacks. Try to get this if you can.
### C2
### C3
### C4
### C5
### C6

# How To Play
### Combo abbreviations
N: **N**ormal Attack
C: **C**harged Attack
NxC: Perform Normal Attack x times, then Charged Attack.
E: Elemental Skill
Q: Elemental Burst

### Non-Amp Build
Generally, if you're not playing Amp reactions (Vaporize/Melt), spamming N2C yields maximum motion value per second, which translates to maximum DPS. Use Skill-Charge and Burst-Charge off cooldown in between.

### Amp Build
If you *do* care about those reactions though, You'll need to adjust. Vaporizing or Melting Yanfei's hits requires Yanfei to be the trigger, but N2C applies Pyro too fast for those. Reasons being how fast her Normal Attack animation is, and her Ascension 4 passive applying another separate instance of Pyro.

# Artifacts
## Amp build
### Main stats
- Sands: *Elemental Mastery* or *ATK*
- Cup: *Pyro DMG Bonus*
- Hat: *Crit Rate* or *Crit Damage*
The main stats are built like typical DPS. However, EM Sands actually yields slightly better damage compared to ATK Sands. The difference isn't much though so choose whichever one you have with better substats.  
Building Energy Recharge on Yanfei is *not worth it*. Even though you get to ult more often, it doesn't compensate for the damage loss from not using EM or ATK Sands.
### Substats
Crit Rate/Crit Damage > ATK%/EM > ER  
Typical DPS substat priority. Again, ER is useful to have, but ATK% and EM are still better.
### Set Bonus
1. 4x Wanderer's Troupe
    This set is generally regarded as best in slot for Amp Yanfei. It helps amplify Yanfei's Charge Attack damage with 80 EM and 35% Charge Attack DMG Bonus. However, this set is very hard to farm so you might not have pieces with actually good substats.
2. 4x Crimson Witch of Flames
    This set is comparable to Wanderer's Troupe. It also helps amplify Yanfei's damage with 15% Pyro DMG Bonus and the 4x effect. The reaction damage portion of the 4x effect is slightly better than 80 EM from Wanderer's Troupe. Meanwhile, the 2x effect increase portion you'll realistically only have 1-2 stacks, so it's slightly lower than Wanderer's Troupe's 35% bonus, but it also improves the damage of Normal Attack and Elemental Skill. As a result, choosing which set to use comes down to substats.
3. 4x Retracing Bolide
    This set is for those with C4 or shield support. It's playable but you'll need to be mindful of the shield's uptime. Use it if you can fulfill the shield condition and it has good substats.

- Overload needs 1.6 testing but presumably still ATK/Pyro/Crit
