# Introduction
Yanfei is a Pyro Catalyst character released in 1.5. Her kit focuses heavily on Charge Attacks.
\[Write about Yanfei's role, how she plays, etc\]
## Pros
- Absurdly long range
\[TODO Add more pros\]
## Cons
- Low stamina due to constant Charge Attacks
\[TODO Add more cons\]

# Builds
Yanfei's role is a selfish main DPS. She will be on field most of the time, only swap to unleash the supports' skills and swap back.  
As with other Pyro DPS, there are generally two ways to build Yanfei based on the Elemental Reaction you want to use.
### Amp Yanfei
This build uses Vaporize or Melt to amplify Yanfei's damage. This means Yanfei will be the *trigger* for the reaction. Usually it'll be Vaporize, as Melt doesn't last long before Yanfei's Pyro application takes over. Due to some quirks in Yanfei's own kit, Amp Yanfei requires specific combo depending on your support. The combos will be discussed in detail further in this guide.

### Enabler Yanfei
This build uses Yanfei to apply Pyro *aura* and enable Elemental Reactions of your sub-DPS. Reverse Melt and Mono Pyro teams are in this category. Overload might be in this category as well if Yanfei is the aura, but that'll depend on your team.

# Talents
## Normal Attack: Seal of Approval
![Normal Attack: Seal of Approval](images/talents/normal.png)  
Yanfei's basic attack talent. As a Main DPS unit, Yanfei's **main source of DPS** involves her **Charged Attack** and the **Scarlet Seals** mechanics. The Scarlet Seals, generated by Normal Attacks, **increase the power of Yanfei's Charged Attack** and **reduce her stamina consumption**. The Seals are consumed in the process.

## Signed Edict
![Signed Edict](images/talents/eskill.png)  
Yanfei's Elemental Skill. Deals a moderate amount of damage once and **generates the maximum number of Scarlet Seals**. The best part of this talent is, of course, the Scarlet Seals, which doesn't scale per talent levels at all, so there is no need to invest in this talent.

## Done Deal
![Done Deal](images/talents/eburst.png)  
Yanfei's Elemental Burst. Deals a moderate amount of damage, generates the maximum number of Scarlet Seals at activation, **generates one more Seals per second**, and **increses Yanfei's Charged Attack DMG**, for 15 seconds. As said above, Yanfei's entire kit revolves around Charged Attacks, and this talent signifies how much it does.

## Passive: Encyclopedic Expertise
![Encyclopedic Expertise](images/talents/passive.png)  
*Displays the location of nearby resources unique to Liyue on the mini-map.*
Helps a bit on material gathering.

## Ascension 1: Proviso
![Proviso](images/talents/ascend1.png)  
*When Yanfei consumes Scarlet Seals by using a Charged Attack, each Scarlet Seal will **increase Yanfei's Pyro DMG Bonus by 5%**. This effect lasts for 6s. When a Charged Attack is used again during the effect's duration, it will dispel the previous effect.*
Free Damage. Each time Yanfei performs a Charged Attack, a number will appear to signify how many Seals are consumed.

## Ascension 4: Blazing Eye
![Blazing Eye](images/talents/ascend4.png)  
*When Yanfei's Charged Attack deals a CRIT Hit to opponents, she will deal an additional instance of **AoE Pyro DMG equal to 80% of her ATK**. This DMG counts as Charged Attack DMG.*
More Damage. However, unlike the Ascension 1 Passive, this one isn't free. The additional hit comes with **additional Pyro application**, which can disturb the aura application of the team's supports. This talent is the main cause of the need to modify Yanfei's combo to fit her supports, which will be detailed below.

### Talent Priority
Normal Attack > Elemental Burst >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Elemental Skill

# Constellations
### C1
Best constellation. This constellation helps alleviate stamina issues and makes Yanfei able to spam more Charge Attacks. Try to get this if you can.
### C2
### C3
### C4
### C5
### C6

# How To Play
### Combo abbreviations
N: **N**ormal Attack
C: **C**harged Attack
NxC: Perform Normal Attack x times, then Charged Attack.
E: Elemental Skill
Q: Elemental Burst

### Non-Amp Build
Generally, if you're not playing Amp reactions (Vaporize/Melt), spamming N2C yields maximum motion value per second, which translates to maximum DPS. Use Skill-Charge and Burst-Charge off cooldown in between.

### Amp Build
If you *do* care about those reactions though, You'll need to adjust. Vaporizing or Melting Yanfei's hits requires Yanfei to be the trigger, but N2C applies Pyro too fast for those. Reasons being how fast her Normal Attack animation is, and her Ascension 4 passive applying another separate instance of Pyro.

# Artifacts
## Amp build
### Main stats
- Sands: *Elemental Mastery* or *ATK*
- Cup: *Pyro DMG Bonus*
- Hat: *Crit Rate* or *Crit Damage*
The main stats are built like typical DPS. However, EM Sands actually yields slightly better damage compared to ATK Sands. The difference isn't much though so choose whichever one you have with better substats.  
Building Energy Recharge on Yanfei is *not worth it*. Even though you get to ult more often, it doesn't compensate for the damage loss from not using EM or ATK Sands.
### Substats
Crit Rate/Crit Damage > ATK%/EM > ER  
Typical DPS substat priority. Again, ER is useful to have, but ATK% and EM are still better.
### Set Bonus
1. 4x Wanderer's Troupe
    This set is generally regarded as best in slot for Amp Yanfei. It helps amplify Yanfei's Charge Attack damage with 80 EM and 35% Charge Attack DMG Bonus. However, this set is very hard to farm so you might not have pieces with actually good substats.
2. 4x Crimson Witch of Flames
    This set is comparable to Wanderer's Troupe. It also helps amplify Yanfei's damage with 15% Pyro DMG Bonus and the 4x effect. The reaction damage portion of the 4x effect is slightly better than 80 EM from Wanderer's Troupe. Meanwhile, the 2x effect increase portion you'll realistically only have 1-2 stacks, so it's slightly lower than Wanderer's Troupe's 35% bonus, but it also improves the damage of Normal Attack and Elemental Skill. As a result, choosing which set to use comes down to substats.
3. 4x Retracing Bolide
    This set is for those with C4 or shield support. It's playable but you'll need to be mindful of the shield's uptime. Use it if you can fulfill the shield condition and it has good substats.

- Overload needs 1.6 testing but presumably still ATK/Pyro/Crit
