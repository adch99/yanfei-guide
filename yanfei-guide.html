pull ahead, you need to be on field for around 12 seconds. However,
you’ll want to swap Yanfei out not long after that since that’s around
when the supports’ buffs run out. That said, the <strong>crit
stat</strong> still makes it easier to build artifacts, and the

considering how squishy she is. Overall, this weapon is still very good

Furthermore, Yanfei can use <strong>all</strong> of its three effects
extremely well, especially if you play with Vaporize. The only downside
is its long cooldown, which affect the overall damage output if you play
Yanfei as a sustained DPS. At <strong>high refine</strong>, it’s a very

options might be better.</td>

Adventure event, is another great choice. It grants <strong>bonus to
Charged Attack</strong>, which is a big portion of Yanfei’s output.
Compared to The Widsith, this weapon <strong>doesn’t lose effectiveness
in a long fight</strong> and <strong>is very easy to max
refine</strong>, so it can be a better choice than low refine Widsith. A
solid weapon overall.</td>

stat</strong>. Although, its effect, <strong>granting Normal Attack,
Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst DMG Bonus</strong>, isn’t big
compared to the other two above due to how big of a deal Charged Attacks
are for Yanfei. Overall it’s slightly worse than The Widsith and Dodoco
Tales, but still a viable choice. You can’t go wrong with a battle pass
weapon.</td>

<h1 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h1>
<h3 id="main-stats">Main stats</h3>
<p>The main stats are built like typical DPS.<br />
- <strong>Sands:</strong> <em>Elemental Mastery</em> or
<em>ATK</em><br />
- <strong>Cup:</strong> <em>Pyro DMG Bonus</em><br />
- <strong>Hat:</strong> <em>CRIT Rate</em> or <em>CRIT Damage</em></p>
<p>The choices for Cup and Hat are usually undisputed. In general, you
want to evenly distribute each stat that contributes to damage output.
DMG Bonus and CRIT stats are hard to come by, so they are the preferred
choices for the slots that can get them. Although, since Yanfei has so
many sources of DMG Bonus, there might be a case for an ATK Cup if its
substats are much better than your Pyro Cup, but it really depends on
the actual piece you have.</p>
<p>For the Sands choice, it depends on what your Yanfei does for your
team.<br />
- <strong>Melt, Vaporize (“Amp” build):</strong> Prefer
<strong>Elemental Mastery</strong> Sands. It has slightly better damage
output, especially if you use an ATK% weapon and have Bennett buff your
ATK further. However, <strong>ATK</strong> Sands still has a chance to
pull ahead if it has much better substats.<br />
- <strong>Overload, Reverse Melt, Mono Pyro, etc (“Enabler”
build):</strong> Use <strong>ATK</strong> Sands. It improves Yanfei’s
Charged Attack damage, the largest portion of her DPS. Even with 1.6
buff, it’s still <strong>not recommended to build EM for the Overload
build</strong> as it isn’t guaranteed that Yanfei will always be the
trigger.<br />
- Regarding <strong>Energy Recharge</strong> Sands, building it on
Yanfei is <strong>not worth it</strong>. The DMG Bonus from the
Elemental Burst is <strong>not big enough</strong> that you need to use
it every rotation to do good damage, so you’re better off just
<strong>improving Yanfei’s damage through the actual damage
stats</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="substats">Substats</h3>
<p>Crit Rate/Crit Damage &gt; EM &gt; ATK% &gt; ER</p>
<p>Typical DPS substat priority. Energy Recharge is good if you can go
from ulting <strong>every other</strong> rotation to ulting
<strong>every</strong> rotation, but otherwise prefer the damage stats.
<strong>Ignore Elemental Mastery if you don’t Melt or
Vaporize.</strong></p>

to have C4 or shield support while playing this set. The raw damage this

comes with more Shield Strength. Overall, this set is playable if you

<p>Please be aware that generally a set <strong>bonus</strong> is just
that, a bonus. It’s usually better to have an off-set piece with good
substats than to complete a set with bad substat. Punch your artifacts
into a calculator if you want to optimise your DPS.</p>
<h1 id="team-compositions">Team Compositions</h1>
<h4 id="vaporize">Vaporize</h4>
<p><img src="images/mugshots/yanfei.png" style="width:15.0%"
alt="Yanfei" /> <img src="images/mugshots/xingqiu.png"

style="width:15.0%" alt="Flex" /><br />
Pairing a Pyro DPS and a Hydro support to <strong>amplify Pyro damage
via Vaporize</strong> is the gold standard composition since launch.
Obviously, it involves Xingqiu, the premier Hydro support guy. You can
replace Xingqiu with another Hydro support like Mona or Barbara with
varying results. This playstyle often <strong>requires specific combos
for Yanfei</strong> to properly <strong>Vaporize her big hits</strong>,
which will be detailed below. The flex slots usually consist of buffers
and healers: Zhongli for his shield and RES shred, Diona for healing and
C6 EM buff, Sucrose for EM buff and RES shred, or Bennett for ATK buff
and healing. The main benefit of this team is how it will give good
results just by hyperinvesting in Yanfei: Get her to level 80, ascension
6, max her weapons, her talents, and her artifacts, and you’re good to
go.</p>
<h4 id="taser">Taser</h4>
<p><img src="images/mugshots/yanfei.png" style="width:15.0%"
alt="Yanfei" /> <img src="images/mugshots/xingqiu.png"
style="width:15.0%" alt="Xingqiu" /> <img
src="images/mugshots/fischl.png" style="width:15.0%" alt="Fischl" />
<img src="images/mugshots/flex.png" style="width:15.0%"
alt="Flex" /><br />
This composition is similar to the Vaporize team. In addition to a Hydro
suppoert, an Electro support is also used to benefit from additional
reactions. Enemies affected by <strong>Electro-Charged</strong> have
both Electro and Hydro auras remained on them, so a Pyro hit will
trigger <strong>both Vaporize and Overload</strong> at the same time.
Like the Vaporize team, you can swap Xingqiu and Fischl out for another
support of the same element, and anything said about the Vaporize team
applies here as well.</p>
<h4 id="overload">Overload</h4>

This team utilises the <strong>Overload</strong> reaction, with Yanfei
as the on-field <strong>enabler</strong> for the team. It is often
undesirable to use Overload against small targets since they’ll be
blasted away. However, unlike other Pyro DPS, Yanfei can utilise her
<strong>very long range</strong> to keep attacking those enemies, and
blasting them away makes it safer to continue attacking. Although,
unlike the Vaporize team, Yanfei’s personal damage doesn’t get amplified
to stellar level, and that means this team needs <strong>more damage
from the supports</strong>, and you’ll need to <strong>actually build
them</strong> up before the overall team damage becomes competitive.</p>
<h4 id="reverse-melt">Reverse Melt</h4>
<p><img src="images/mugshots/yanfei.png" style="width:15.0%"

This team uses Yanfei as an <strong>enabler</strong> for the Melt
reaction with a Cryo sub-DPS. In this comp, it’s important to build the
Cryo unit first since it’s their damage that will get amplified. Also,
since you’ll want the aura on enemies to be Pyro most of the time, and
Yanfei is rarely the reaction trigger, the Lavawalker set becomes
another contender for preferred artifact sets.</p>
<h4 id="mono-pyro">Mono Pyro</h4>
<p><img src="images/mugshots/yanfei.png" style="width:15.0%"

<img src="images/mugshots/flex.png" style="width:15.0%"
alt="Flex" /><br />
This team utilises Pyro units that <strong>benefit from other Pyro
units</strong>, like Xiangling and Bennett. It’ll constantly apply Pyro
aura and can utilise Lavawalker for DMG Bonus.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="attack-combos">Attack Combos</h2>
<p>Most of Yanfei’s damage in an attack combo will come from her Charged
Attack. Thus, it’s logical that Yanfei’s combos usually goes in the form
of <strong>“something, followed by a Charged Attack”</strong>.</p>
<p>Using to the frame data, we can conclude that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting from zero Scarlet Seals, the attack string that
<strong>deals the most damage per frame</strong> is
<strong>N2C</strong>.</li>
<li>N3C has lower damage, but it <strong>consumes less stamina</strong>
due to more time to recharge and more Scarlet Seals. It can be useful
for stamina management.</li>
<li>In terms of animation cancelling, Yanfei has <strong>Charge
Cancelling</strong> as her only useful tech. It involves holding your
attack button for Charged Attack right after a Normal Attack, to make
Yanfei’s Charged Attack come out earlier. This encourages thinking about
how many Normal Attacks you’re going to perform beforehand.</li>
<li>Jump and Dash Cancelling are <strong>not</strong> necessary. Jump
Cancelling doesn’t improve Yanfei’s DPS, and Dash Cancelling consumes
too much stamina to be useful in normal play.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the Elemental Skill and Burst:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should generally use Elemental Skill whenever it’s available,
then, since it generates maximum Scarlet Seals, immediately follow with
a Charged Attack.</li>
<li>The Elemental Burst should be immediately followed by a Charged
Attack for the same reason.</li>
<li>During burst, Yanfei will generate one Scarlet Seal per second,
which usually translates to one more Seal per combo. This means,
starting from zero Seals, N2C will have 3 Seals, and N3C will have 3
Seals (w/o C6) or 4 Seals (w/ C6).</li>
<li>Without C6, N2C has the <strong>same damage and stamina
consumption</strong> as N3C during burst, but uses significantly less
time.</li>
<li>Even <strong>with</strong> C6, <strong>N2C still deals more damage
per frame</strong>. However, <strong>N3C will consume zero
stamina</strong> (because 4 Seals) and become the ultimate stamina
management tool.</li>
<li>If you have both the Elemental Skill and Burst available, the
logical combo of these two would be <strong>QC EC</strong>, since the
Charged Attack after E will also be boosted by Q.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="elemental-reactions">Elemental Reactions</h2>
<p>Generally, the above info applies to the playstyles that
<strong>doesn’t care</strong> about who triggers the reaction (like
Overload) or <strong>wants Pyro aura</strong> on enemies anyway (Reverse
Melt and Mono Pyro).</p>
<p>When <strong>Amplifying</strong> Elemental Reactions are taken into
account, like the <strong>Vaporize</strong> and <strong>Taser</strong>
team, the combos will need to be re-evaluated. Yanfei has <strong>very
fast Pyro application</strong>, and her <strong>Ascension 4
Passive</strong> adds even more of it. Since each of Yanfei’s hits
aren’t equal, you need to <strong>be selective of which hit to
Vaporize</strong> (meaning you should Vaporize the Charged Attack
whenever possible). This will be different depending on your Hydro
applier.</p>
<h4 id="elemental-skill-and-burst">Elemental Skill and Burst</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the enemy has Hydro aura, it’s sometimes better to use
<strong>EC QC</strong> (Elemental <strong>Skill</strong> first). The
reason is because the Elemental Burst’s initial hit applies stronger
Pyro, which will wipe out the Hydro aura. Meanwhile, the Elemental
Skill’s Pyro application leaves Hydro aura to <strong>Vaporize the
subsequent Charged Attack hit</strong> and deal more damage as a
result.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="xingqiu">Xingqiu</h4>
<p>Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst is the best Hydro application in the game
at the moment. The Hydro swords appear on Normal Attacks and can happen
every 1 second.</p>
<ul>
<li>As it stands, N2C won’t Vaporize Yanfei’s Charged Attack hits
consistently.</li>
<li>You’ll need to do <strong>N3C</strong>. The third Normal Attack will
trigger Xingqiu’s swords one more time, clearing Pyro aura from Yanfei’s
earlier attack and re-apply Hydro. Subsequent Charged Attack then
Vaporizes the Hydro aura, dealing big damage.</li>
<li>You can also utilise Xingqiu’s “orbital” swords (the ones around
your character that reduces damage and heal you) to apply more Hydro
aura. This will enable N2C, but it requires putting a squishy,
long-range character in melee range, so it’s not desirable.</li>
<li>Xingqiu’s <strong>Constellation 6</strong> adds more swords to his
Elemental Burst, and that means more Hydro application. It adds a
5-sword hit to the usual loop, so his [2, 3]-sword loop becoms [2, 3,
5]-sword loop.</li>
<li>This means you can get away with N2C <strong>during the 5-sword
round</strong>, since there will still be Hydro aura on the enemy
without another Hydro application.</li>
<li>Assuming no dodges, the combo becomes <strong>N3C, N2C,
repeat</strong>. The first N3C triggers the 2-sword hit and the 3-sword
hit, then N2C triggers the 5-sword hit.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>This is a quick TL;DR for this guide. For more information, refer to
the texts above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yanfei is a Main DPS. Her kit heavily utilises Charged Attacks and
Scarlet Seals.</li>
<li>C1, C5, and C6 are good. C2 and C4 are average. C3 is bad.</li>
<li>Use 5-star weapon if you have them. Otherwise, best 4-stars are R5
Widsith and R5 Dodoco Tales.</li>
<li>EM/Pyro/Crit for Amp build. ATK/Pyro/Crit for Enabler build.</li>
<li>Can be built with Vaporize, Taser, Overload, Reverse Melt, or Mono
Pyro team, along with other compositions not covered by this guide.</li>
<li>Always follow attack strings, E, and Q with a Charged Attack.</li>
<li>N2C for damage, N3C for stamina management.</li>
<li>With Xingqiu, always N3C for consistent Vaporize. With Xingqiu C6,
N3C N2C is also fine.</li>
